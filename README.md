# Real-estate-investment-analysis
Built a Data product and an interactive shiny dashboard to identify properties and zip codes generating most profit on short term rentals


Steps to run the markdown report: 
1. Download the .Rmd file. 
2. Copy and Paste it in the same location as the zipfile "Zip_Zhvi_2bedroom.csv.zip" shared by Capital One
  (Make it as the working directory)
3. Open the Rmd file in RStudio and run the document ("Run Document" with a play button)
4. The AirBnB dataset will be directly downloaded from the link provided, 
   hence we need an internet connection
Info: A warning message will be displayed in the code if the file is not downloaded


Notes:

The tabs "Data Cleaning", "Data Preparation", and "Analysis" in
the output have multiple tabs under them. Please take time to review all 
tabs. Thank you!
